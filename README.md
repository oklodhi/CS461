# CS461 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
This repository highlights my course work completed while I was taking CS461 Intro to A.I. at UMKC.

## Project 1
I coded an A* algorithm that solves different 8-puzzles by determining if a path exists and picking the best possible path out of the given options. 8-puzzles are puzzle with 3x3 grid of tiles that need to be rearranged in the correct order by shifting tiles around as seen below. This algorithm can be expanded to any other NxN puzzl configuration.

## Project 2
This is an implementation of Simulated Annealing algorithm. Given a list of criteria and boundaries, the program generates the best possible class schedule for several university courses, with the highest possible fitness score.
